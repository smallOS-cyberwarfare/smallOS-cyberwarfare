# Nuclei Configuration Profile for Subdomain Takeover Detection
#
# This configuration file is specifically tailored for detecting subdomain takeovers using Nuclei.
#
# Purpose:
# This profile is focused on identifying subdomain takeover vulnerabilities across different cloud service providers.
# Subdomain takeovers can occur when a DNS entry points to a deprovisioned or unclaimed cloud resource, potentially
# allowing an attacker to claim the resource and hijack the subdomain.
#
# Included Templates:
# This configuration references specific templates designed to detect subdomain takeover scenarios:
# - http/takeovers/: This directory contains general templates for detecting HTTP-based subdomain takeovers.
# - dns/azure-takeover-detection.yaml: This template specifically checks for subdomain takeovers on Microsoft Azure.
# - dns/elasticbeanstalk-takeover.yaml: This template specifically checks for subdomain takeovers on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
#
# Running this profile
# You can run this profile using the following command :
# nuclei -profile subdomain-takeovers -u https://www.example.com

templates:
  - http/takeovers/
  - dns/azure-takeover-detection.yaml
  - dns/elasticbeanstalk-takeover.yaml
